# [Domain-2](#domain-2-asset-security) **Asset Security**

- Domain 2 of the CISSP exam covers asset security making up ~10% of the test
- Asset security includes the concepts, principles, and standards of monitoring and securing any asset important to the organization
- The Asset Security domain focuses on collecting, handling, and protecting information throughout its lifecycle; the first step is classifying information based on its value to the organization
- **Anonymization**: replaces privacy data with useful but inaccurate data; the dataset can be shared, but anonymization removes individual identities; anonymization is permanent
- **Asset**: anything of value owned by the organization
- **Asset lifecycle**: phases an asset goes through, from creation (or collection) to destruction
- **EPROM / UVEPROM**: erasable programmable read-only memory, is a type of programmable read-only memory (PROM) chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off; chips my be erased with ultraviolet light
- **EEPROM**: Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory; chips may be erased with electrical current
- **PROM**: programmable read-only memory, a form of digital memory where the contents can be changed once after manufacture of the device
- **RAM**: Random Access Memory - volatile memory that loses contents when the computer is powered off
- **Randomized masking**: an anonymization method that cannot be reversed when done correctly
- **ROM**: nonvolatile memory that can't be written to by end users
- **TEMPEST**: a classification of technology designed to minimize the electromagnetic emanations generated by computing devices; TEMPEST technology makes it difficult, if not impossible, to compromise confidentiality by capturing emanated information; TEMPEST countermeasures to Van Eck phreaking (i.e. eavesdropping), include Faraday cages, white noise, control zones, and shielding

## [2.1](#21-identify-and-classify-information-assets-osg-9-chpt-5) Identify and classify information assets (OSG-9 Chpt 5)

- 2.1.1 Data classification
  - Managing the data lifecycle refers to protecting it from cradle to grave -- steps need to be taken to protect data when it's first created until it's destroyed
  - One of the first steps in the lifecycle is identifying and classifying information and assets, often within a security policy
  - In this context, assets include sensitive data, the hardware used to process that data, and the media used to store/hold it
  - **Data categorization**: process of grouping sets of data, info or knowledge that have comparable sensitivities (e.g. impact or loss rating), and have similar law/contract/compliance security needs; the act of assigning a classification level to an asset
  - **Sensitive data**: any information that isn't public or unclassified, and can include anything an org needs to protect due to its value, or to comply with existing laws and regulations
  - **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: any information that can identify an individual
    - more specifically, info about an individual including (1) any info that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information ([NIST SP 800-122](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-122/final))
  - **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: any health-related information that can be related to a specific person
  - **Proprietary data**: any data that helps an organization maintain a competitive edge
  - Organizations classify data using labels
    - government classification labels include:
      - **Top Secret**: if disclosed, could cause massive damage to national security, such as the disclosure of spy satellite information
      - **Secret**: if disclosed, can adversely affect national security
      - **Unclassified**: not sensitive
    - non-government organizations use labels such as:
      - **Confidential/Proprietary**: only used within the org and, in the case of unauthorized disclosure, it could suffer serious consequences
      - **Private**: may include personal information, such as credit card data and bank accounts; unauthorized disclosure can be disastrous
      - **Sensitive**: needs extraordinary precautions to ensure confidentiality and integrity
      - **Public**: can be viewed by the general public and, therefore, the disclosure of this data would not cause damage
    - labels can be as granular and custom as required by the org
  - It is important to protect data in all states: at rest, in transit, or in use
  - The best way to protect data confidentiality is via use of strong encryption

- 2.1.2 Asset Classification
  - It's important to identify and classify assets, such as systems, mobile devices etc.
  - Owners are accountable for an asset and protecting its value
  - **Classification**: assigning assets the level of protection required based on their value to the org; assets require identified owner to be classified and protected adequately; derived from compliance mandates, the process of recognizing organizational impacts if information suffers any security compromise (whether to confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, authenticity, privacy, or safety)
  - Asset classifications should match data classification, i.e. if a computer is processing top secret data, the computer should be classified as a top secret asset
  - **Clearance**: relates to access of certain classification of data or equipment, and who has access to that level or classification
  - A **formal access approval process** should be used to change user access; the process should involve approval from the data/asset owner, and the user should be informed about rules and limits
    - before a user is granted access they should be educated on working with that level of classification
  - Classification levels can be used by businesses during acquisitions, ensuring only personnel who need to know are involved in the assessment or transition
  - In general, classification labels help users use data and assets properly, for instance by restricting dissemination or use of assets by their classification
  - Asset classification should include based on confidentiality (sensitivity), integrity (accuracy), and availability (criticality)

## [2.2](#22-establish-information-and-asset-handling-requirements-osg-9-chpt-5) Establish information and asset handling requirements (OSG-9 Chpt 5)

- **Asset handling**: procedures that mitigate risks associated with who and how assets are moved, stored, and retrieved ensuring proper tools and technologies used; handling requirements are based on the classification of the asset (not the media type); handling can refer to secure transport of media through its lifetime
- The data and asset handling key goal is to prevent data breaches, by using:
  - **Data Maintenance**: on-going efforts to organize and care for data through its life cycle
  - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: systems that detect and block data exfiltration attempts; two primary types:
    - network-based DLP
    - endpoint-based DLP
- **Labeling**: the association of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures; *labels are system-readable* and enable system-based enforcement of security policies; labeling often uses things like: metadata, barcodes, QR codes, RFID or GPS tags
- **Marking**: association of security attributes in a *human-readable form*, enabling process-based enforcement of security policies; sensitive information/assets ensures proper handling (both physically and electronically)
- **Data Collection Limitation**: prevent loss by not collecting unnecessary sensitive data; a best practice when collecting customer data, for instance, is to limit the amount of data collected to only what is needed
- **Data Location**: keep dup copies of backups, on- and off-site
- **Storage**: data storage and associated media are based on the classification of the data; define storage locations and procedures by storage type; use physical locks for paper-based media, and encrypt electronic data
- **Destruction**: retention and destruction of data should be based on data classification and archiving policies; destroy data no longer needed by the organization; policy should define acceptable destruction methods by type and classification ([see NIST SP-800-88 for details](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-88/rev-1/final))
  - **Erasing**: usually refers to a delete operation on media, leaving data remanence
  - **Clearing**: removal of sensitive data from a storage device such that there is assurance data may not be reconstructed using normal functions or software recovery or software recovery utilities; over-writing existing data; it's not very strong, and there's a chance that the data could be brought back
  - **Purging**: removal of sensitive data from a system or device with the intent that data cannot be reconstructed by any known technique; usually refers to multiple clearing passes combined with other tools; often means getting rid of data in more reliable ways, like using a strong magnetic field (degaussing) to destroy data on storage devices (see below) -- although not considered acceptable for top secret data; writing a series of 1s and 0s over media multiple times is a purging technique
  - **Destruction**: includes physically destroying media through shredding, burning, pulverizing, or incinerating, and also includes the use of strong encryption to logically destroy data; a surer way than even purging
  - **Data Remanence**: data remaining on media after typical erasure; to ensure all remanence is removed, the following tools can help:
  - **Degaussing**: used on magnetic media, removes data from tapes and magnetic hard drives; no affect on optical media or SSDs
  - **(Physical) destruction**: used for SSD/electronic components, or in combination with other less-secure methods; destruction methods include incineration, crushing, shredding, and disintegration
  - **Cryptographic Erasure** (AKA **crypto shredding**): using strong encryption to encrypt data, and then basically destroying encryption key; may be only secure method for cloud storage; again, crypto shredding is the best method for dealing with cloud data remanence
  - **File carving**: computer forensics technique that recovers files from a storage device's raw data based on their structure and content, often used to recover files that are not indexed by the file system, such as those that are deleted, formatted, or encrypted; file carving is also a good method for recovering files if an entire directory is missing or corrupt

## [2.3](#23-provision-resources-securely-osg-9-chpt-16) Provision resources securely (OSG-9 Chpt 16)

- The primary purpose of security operations practices is to safeguard assets such as information, systems, devices, facilities, and apps; these practices help to identify threats, vulnerabilities, and implement controls to reduce the risk to these assets
- Implementing common security operations concepts, along with performing periodic security audits and reviews demonstrates a level of due care
- **Need-to-know**: a principle that imposes the requirement to grant users access only to data or resources they need to perform assigned work tasks; another way of saying this is that need to know means that someone is only given access to an asset if there is an absolute need based on role, function, or specific authorization
- **Least privilege**: a principle stating that subjects are granted only the privileges necessary to perform assigned work tasks and no more; a person is given only absolutely needed access, and nothing more

- 2.3.1 Information and asset ownership
  - **Data owner**: the person who has ultimate organizational responsibility for data; usually sr. manager (CEO,president, dept. head); data owners typically delegate data protection tasks to others in the org; the data owner has to make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to protect the data

- 2.3.2 Asset inventory (e.g., tangible, intangible)
  - **Inventory**: complete list of items
  - **Tangible assets**: include hardware and software assets owned by the company
  - **Intangible assets**: things like patents, copyrights, a company’s reputation, and other assets representing potential revenue
    - an org should keep track of intangible assets, like intellectual property, patents, trademarks, and company’s reputation, and copyrights to protect them
    - note: patents in the US are valid for 20 years

- 2.3.3 Asset management
  - Asset management refers to managing both tangible and intangible assets; this starts with inventories of assets, tracking the assets, and taking additional steps to protect them throughout their lifetime
  - The primary goal of asset management is to prevent losses (by tracking and protecting assets)
  - **Accountability**: ensures account management; only authorized users are accessing a system and using it properly
  - **Hardware assets**: IT resources such as computers, servers, routers, switches and peripherals
    - use an automated configuration management system (CMS) to help with hardware asset management
    - use barcodes, RFID tags to track hardware assets
  - **Software assets**: operating systems and applications
    - important to monitor license compliance to avoid legal issues
    - software licensing also refers to ensuring that systems do not have unauthorized software installed
  - To protect intangible inventories (like intellectual property, patents, trademarks, and company’s reputation, and copyrights), they need to be tracked

## [2.4](#24-manage-data-lifecycle-osg-9-chpt-5) Manage data lifecycle (OSG-9 Chpt 5)

- 2.4.1 Data roles (i.e., owners, controllers, custodians, processors, users/subjects)
  - **System owner**: controls the computer storing the data; usually includes software and hardware configurations and support services (e.g. cloud implementation)
    - data owner is the person responsible for classifying, categorizing, and permitting access to the data; the data owner is the person who is best familiar with the importance of the data to the business
    - system owners are responsible for the systems that process the data
    - system owner is responsible for system operation and maintenance, and associated updating/patching as well as related procurement activities
    - per [NIST SP 800-18](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-18r1.pdf), information **system owner** has the following responsibilities:
      - responsible for the security of the system that stores or processes the data
      - develops the system security plan
      - maintains the system security plan and ensures that the system is deployed/operated according to security requirements
      - ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training
      - updates the system security plan as required
      - assists in the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common security controls
  - **Data controller**: decide what data to process and how to process it
    - the data controller is the person or entity that controls the processing of the data - deciding what data to process, why this data should be processed, and how it is processed
    - e.g. a company that collects personal information on employees for payroll is a data controller (but, if they pass this info to a third-party to process payroll, the payroll company is the data processor, see below)
  - **Data processor**: an entity *working* on behalf (or the direction) of the data controller, that processes PII; they have a responsibility to protect the privacy of the data and not use it for any purpose other than directed by the data controller; generally, a data processor is any system used to process data
    - processing data on behalf of the Data Controller while ensuring quality, validation, and compliance, safe custody, transport, storage of the data and implementation of business rules
    - a controller can hire a third party to process data, and in this context, the third party is the data processor; data processors are often third-party entities that process data for an org at the direction of the data controller
    - note GDPR definition: "a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body, which processes personal data solely on behalf of the data controller"
      - GDPR also restricts data transfers to countries outside EU, with fines for violations
      - many orgs have created dedicated roles to oversee GDPR data laws are followed
  - **Data custodian**: a custodian is delegated, from the system owner, day-to-day responsibilities for properly storing and protecting data; responsible for the protection of data through maintenance activities, backing up and archiving, and preventing the loss or corruption and recovering data
  - **Data steward**: a data steward has business responsibility for data (e.g. data quality, governance, compliance, metadata definition etc)
  - **Security administrator**: responsible for ensuring the overall security of entire infrastructure; they perform tasks that lead to the discovery of vulnerabilities, monitor network traffic and configure tools to protect the network (like firewalls and antivirus software)
    - security admins also devise security policies, plans for business continuity and disaster recovery and train staff
  - **Supervisors**: responsible for overseeing the activities of all the above entities and all support personnel; they ensure team activities are conducted smoothly and that personnel is properly skilled for the tasks assigned
  - **Users**: any person who accesses data from a computer device or system to accomplish work (think of users as employees or end users)
    - users should have access to the data they need to perform tasks; users should have access to data according to their roles and their need to access info
    - must comply with rules, mandatory policies, standards and procedures
    - users fall into the category of subjects, and a subject is any entity that accesses an object such as a file or folder 
      - note that subjects can be users, programs, processes, services, computers, or anything else that can access a resource (OSG-9 Chpts 8, 13)
- 2.4.2 Data Collection
  - One of the easiest ways of preventing the loss of data is to simply not collect it
  - The **data collection guideline**: if the data doesn't have a clear purpose for use, don't collect it, and don't store it; this is why many privacy regulations mention limiting data collection
- 2.4.3 Data location
  - **Data location**: in this context, refers to the location of data backups or data copies
  - If a company's system is on-prem, keeps data on-site, but regularly backups up data, best practice is to keep a backup copy on site and backup copy off-site
  - Consider distance between data/storage locations to mitigate potential mutual (primary and backup) damage risk

- 2.4.4 Data maintenance
  - **Data maintenance**: managing data through the data lifecycle (creation, usage, retirement); data maintenance is the process (often automated) of making sure the data is available (or not available) based on where it is in the lifecycle
  - Ensuring appropriate asset protection requires that sensitive data be preserved for a period of not less than what is business-required, but for no longer than necessary
  - Encrypt sensitive data
  - Safeguard assets via basic security controls to enforce appropriate levels of confidentiality, integrity and availability and act per security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines
- 2.4.5 Data retention
  - Retention requirements apply to data or records, media holding sensitive data, systems that process sensitive data, and personnel who have access to sensitive data
    - **record retention**: retaining and maintaining info as long as it is needed, and destroying it when its no longer needed
      - note: a current trend in many orgs is to reduce legal liabilities by implementing short retention policies with email
  - Three fundamental retention policy questions:
    - **how to retain**: data should be kept in a manner that makes it accessible whenever required; take taxonomy (or the scheme for data classification) into account
    - **how long to retain data**: general guidelines for business data is 7 years (but can vary by country/region/regulation)
    - **what data**: to retain per org requirements
- 2.4.6 Data remanence
  - **Data remanence**: the data remaining on media after the data is supposedly erased
    - typically refers to data on a hard drive as residual magnetic flux or slack space (unused space within a disk cluster)
      - note that many OSs store files in clusters, which are groups of sectors (the smallest storage unit on a hard disk drive)
    - if media includes any type of private and sensitive data, it is important to eliminate data remanence
    - note that some OSs fill slack space with data from memory, which is why personnel should never process classified data on unclassified systems

- 2.4.7 Data destruction
  - Destroy sensitive data when it is no longer needed
  - An org's security or data policy should define the acceptable methods of destroying data based on the data's classification
  - a degausser can be used on a hard disk drives/magnetic media
  - the best SSD wiping method is destruction -- even when using manufacturers SSD wiping tools, data can remain, and therefore the best SSD wipe method is destruction
  - **Defensible destruction**: eliminating data using a controlled, legally defensible and regulatory-compliant way

## [2.5](#25-ensure-appropriate-asset-retention-eg-end-of-life-eol-end-of-support-eos-osg-9-chpt-5) Ensure appropriate asset retention (e.g. End-of-Life EOL, End-of-Support (EOS)) (OSG-9 Chpt 5)

- Hardware: even if you maintain data for the appropriate retention period, it won’t do you any good if you don’t have hardware that can read the data
- Personnel: beyond retaining data for required time periods and maintaining hardware to read the data, you need personnel who know how to operate the hardware to execute restoration processes

- **End-Of-Life (EOL)**: often identified by vendors as the time when they stop offering a product for sale
- **End-Of-Support (EOS)/End-Of-Service-Life (EOSL)**: often used to identify when support ends for a product
- EOL,EOS/EOSL can apply to either software or hardware

## [2.6](#26-determine-data-security-controls-and-compliance-requirements-osg-9-chpt-5) Determine data security controls and compliance requirements (OSG-9 Chpt 5)

- You need security controls that protect data in each possible state: at rest, in transit or in use
- Each state requires a different approach to security; note that there aren’t as many security options for data in use as there are for data at rest or data in transit
  - keeping the systems patched, maintaining a standard computer build process, and running anti-virus/malware are typically the real-world primary protections for data in use

- 2.6.1 Data states (e.g., in use, in transit, at rest)
  - The three data states are at rest, in transit, and in use
    - **Data at rest**: any data stored on media such as hard drives or external media
    - **Data in transit**: AKA data in motion; any data transmitted over a network
      - encryption methods protect data at rest and in transit
    - **Data in use**: data in memory and used by an application
      - applications should flush memory buffers to remove data after it is no longer needed

- 2.6.2 Scoping and tailoring
  - **Baseline**: documented, lowest level of security config allowed by a standard or org
  - After selecting a control baseline, orgs fine-tune with tailoring and scoping processes; a big part of the tailoring process is aligning controls with an org's specific security requirements
  - **Tailoring**: refers to modifying the list of security controls within a baseline to align with the org's mission
    - includes the following activities:
      - identifying and designating common controls; specification of organization-defined parameters in the security controls via explicit assignment and selection statements
      - applying scoping guidance/considerations
      - selecting/specifying compensating controls
      - assigning control values
  - **Scoping**: setting the boundaries of security control implementation; limiting the general baseline recommendations by removing those that do not apply; part of the tailoring process and refers to reviewing a list of baseline security controls and selecting only those controls that apply to the systems you're trying to protect
    - scoping processes eliminate controls that are recommended in a baseline

- 2.6.3 Standards selection
  - Organizations need to identify the standards (e.g. PCI DSS, GDPR etc) that apply and ensure that the security controls they select fully comply with these standards
  - Even if the org doesn't have to comply with a specific standard, using a well-designed community standard can be helpful (e.g. NIST SP 800 documents)
  - **Standards selection**: the process by which organizations plan, choose and document technologies or architectures for implementation
    - e.g. you evaluate three vendors for a security control; you could use a standards selection process to help determine which solution best fits the org
  - Vendor selection is closely related to standards selection but focuses on the vendors, not the technologies or solutions
  - The overall goal is to have an objective and measurable selection process
    - if you repeat the process with a totally different team, the alternate team should come up with the same selection

- 2.6.4 Data protection methods (e.g., Digital Rights Management (DRM), Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB))
  - **Data protection methods** include:
    - **digital rights management (DRM)**: methods used in attempt to protect copyrighted materials; purpose is to prevent the unauthorized use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works
    - **Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs)**: software placed logically between users and cloud-based resources ensuring that cloud resources have the same protections as resources within a network
      - CASB is a solution for security policy enforcement, ensuring security policies and compliance are met when accessing cloud apps and data; it can be used on-premise or in the cloud
      - the four cornerstones of CASBs are visibility, data security, threat detection, and compliance
    - note that entities must comply with the EU GDPR, and use additional data protection methods/controls such as anonymization and randomized masking (which, when done correctly, can't be reversed), or quasi-anonymization which can be reversed (pseudonymization, tokenization, encryption)
  - One of the primary methods of protecting the confidentiality of data is encryption
  - Options for protecting your data vary depending on its state:
    - Data at rest: consider encryption for operating system volumes and data volumes, and backups as well
      - be sure to consider all locations for data at rest, such as tapes, USB drives, external drives, RAID arrays, SAN, NAS, and optical media
      - DRM is useful for data at rest because DRM "travels with the data" regardless of the data state
        - DRM is especially useful when you can’t encrypt data volumes
    - Data in transit: think of data in transit wholistically -- moving data from anywhere to anywhere; use encryption for data in transit
      - e.g. a web server uses a certificate to encrypt data being viewed by a user, or IPsec encrypting a communication session
      - most important point is to use encryption whenever possible, including for internal-only web apps
      - DLP solutions are useful for data in transit, scanning data on the wire, and stopping the transmission/transfer, based on the DLP rules set (e.g. outbound data that contains numbers matching a social security number pattern, a DLP rule can be used to block that traffic)
    - Data in use:
      - CASB solution often combines DLP, a web application firewall with some type of authentication and authorization, and a network firewall in a single solution; A CASB solution is helpful for protecting data in use (and data in transit)
  - **Pseudonymization**: refers to the process of using pseudonyms to represent other data; process of replacing data elements with pseudonyms or aliases
    - A pseudonym is an alias, and pseudonymization can prevent data from directly identifying an entity (i.e. person)
    - An external dataset holds the original data along with the pseudonym such that the original data can be recreated
    - Therefore, unlike full anonymization, pseudonymized data can be reversed if the key is available
  - **Tokenization**: use of a token, typically a random string of characters, to replace other data
    - note that tokenization is similar to pseudonymization in that they are both used to represent other data, and the token or pseudonym have no meaning or value outside the process that creates and links them to that data
  - example of tokenization used in CC transactions:
    - registration: app on user's smart phone securely sends CC info to the credit card processor (CCP)
      - The CCP sends the CC info to a tokenization vault, creating a token and associating it with the user's phone
    - usage: when the user makes a purchase, the POS system sends the token to the CCP for authorization
    - validation: the CCP sends the token to the tokenization vault; the vault replies with the CC info, the charge is processed
    - completing the sale: the CCP sends a reply to the POS indicating the charge is approved
    - this system prevents CC theft at the POS system
